This is an academic project made for our courses "Automatic Model Selection", "Machine Learning and Statistical Learning" and "Predictive methods". 
The aim is to apply and understand several techniques to predict whether an ad will be clicked or not.
The dataset is to big to be uploaded but you can find it on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/louischen7/2020-digix-advertisement-ctr-prediction
